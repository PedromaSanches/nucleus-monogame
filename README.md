# Nucleus

A lightweight ECS, with messaging queue, for MonoGame.  Provides:

- A basic `Entity` class that can add/remove/get `Component` instances
- A basic library of `Component` classes, like `SpriteComponent` and `InputComponent`
- A messaging mechanism: components broadcast, other components subscribe/receive
